In this project, I created a simple shiny app [(you can find the code here)](https://quarto.org/docs/) that compares the trade-offs between investing in an investeringssparkonto (ISK, a Swedish investment account that taxes wealth instead of capital gains) compared to a regular Depot account (that taxes 30% on capital gains).

try shinylive but manually put in the borrowing rates for now

# How 

1.
Calculate the average value of the account for the year (average of the beginnign of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) (plus any investments during the quarter?)

2.
The tax base for the ISK is determined by multiplying the average value by the government's standard rate, which is calculated as the government borrowing rate plus 1%. For 2023, the standard rate is 3.03%.

Det genomsnittliga värdet på ditt ISK under året multipliceras med statslåneräntan den 30 november året innan, plus 1 procentenhet.

3.
The tax to be paid is 30% of the tax base.

4.Determine the total return before tax, then subtract the tax paid to get the net return. Finally, calculate the annual return as a percentage of the initial value.
